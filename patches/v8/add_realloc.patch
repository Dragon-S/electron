Subject: add_realloc.patch

Blink overrides ArrayBuffer's allocator with its own one, while Node simply
uses malloc and free, so we need to use v8's allocator in Node. As part of the
10.6.0 upgrade, we needed to make SerializerDelegate accept an allocator
argument in its constructor, and override ReallocateBufferMemory and
FreeBufferMemory to use the allocator. We cannot simply allocate and then memcpy
when we override ReallocateBufferMemory, so we therefore need to implement
Realloc on the v8 side.
